# MahAppsMetroWithMvvmLight

Greetings,

I have integrated Mahapps.Metro hamburger menu with MvvmLight. It also uses the navigationService of MvvmLight. Special thanks to SamTheDev(https://github.com/SamTheDev/SampleMvvmLightNavigation) for the nice repo about how to use MvvmLight NavigationService
(https://github.com/SamTheDev/SampleMvvmLightNavigation), and obviously developers of Mahapps.Metro and MvvmLight. 
Can be also installed as VS 2019 template with the .zip file inside the solution. 

A sample pic can be found here: https://github.com/akinbender/MahAppsMetroWithMvvmLight/blob/master/MahAppsMetroMvvmLight/Sample.PNG

I may update the template to add theme manager of Mahapps.Metro..
